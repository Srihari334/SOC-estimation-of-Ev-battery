# âš¡ðŸš— SOC-Based Range Estimation for Electric Vehicles  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on **predicting the estimated range of an electric vehicle (EV) based on its State of Charge (SOC)** and other relevant parameters using machine learning. The goal is to assist EV users and manufacturers in optimizing range predictions for better energy management and decision-making.

## ðŸ›  Features  
- ðŸ”¹ **Machine Learning Model:** Supervised learning algorithms for SOC-based range estimation  
- ðŸ”¹ **Real-World Data Collection:** Dataset obtained from a **Mahindra XUV 400**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Input Parameters:** Voltage, current, SOC, temperature, and other key factors  
- ðŸ”¹ **Python-Based Implementation** for model training and prediction  
- ðŸ”¹ **Data Visualization & Analysis**  

## ðŸ“Š Applications  
âœ… **Battery Management Systems (BMS)** â€“ Improve EV range estimation  
âœ… **Energy Optimization** â€“ Enhance driving efficiency based on SOC predictions  
âœ… **Real-Time EV Monitoring** â€“ Provide accurate range predictions for users
